# PyBer_Analysis
## Background
### PyBer Analysis Overview
This project utilized python/pandas in jupyter notebook to analyze ride-sharing data from the company PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing application. As a new analyst for PyBer, my job was to accurately analyze the data and create compelling visualizations from my analyses to present to the company's CEO.

Two files in .csv format (city_data.csv; ride_data.csv) were provided as starting points for this project. The city_data.csv file contains data in the following columns: city, driver count, and type. The ride_data.csv file contains data in the following columns: city, date, fare, and ride_id. Data from both files was imported, manipulated, and then aggregated into python/pandas dataframes for accessible viewing/analysis.
